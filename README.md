# Neural_Network_Charity_Analysis

## Overview of the analysis

* Compare the differences between the traditional machine learning classification and regression models and the neural network models.
* Describe the perceptron model 
* Implement neural network models using TensorFlow.
* Explain how different neural network structures change algorithm performance.
* Compare the differences between neural network models and deep neural networks.

## Purpose:

A foundation, Alphabet Soup, wants to predict where to make investments. The goal is to use machine learning and neural networks to apply features on a provided dataset to create a binary classifier that is capable of predicting whether applicants will be successful if funded by Alphabet Soup.
